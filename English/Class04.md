- Pre-Reading
  - A. Warm-Up Questions 
    1. What are some jobs that machines can perform better than humans?
       - Usually, jobs that are meant to be repetitive, like in the movie Modern Times (1936) with Charles Chaplin. Also, machine jobs can be designated for very precise tasks, like measuring and cutting a specific type of fiber, metal, shapes and stuff. Of course, if there is a pointlessly iteration of the same work/task, that affects negatively any human being doing the same work, it is prefereble to employ a machine. Dangerous tasks could either be an asset, for example disarming explosive artifacts, or very raw/rought conditions, like on top of a mountain with low air density, or under thousands of meters underwater with it's outrageous pressure.
               
    3. How do you usually feel when new technology is released?
       - Generally, I feel hyped in the begining, and a litle stoked afterwards, when I do realise how deep theese kind of technology can become a burden to our daily lives, with lots of side-effects. In the end, I get myself a bit worried, for we live in the age of stupid-people carrying smarth-phones.
 
    4. What technology do you use the most in your daily life?
       - Basically all the technologies avaliable to someone not living off-the-grid.

- B. Questions
  - 1- What is AI-generated content?
    - It is a kind of content (usually a image, an audio/voice, a text) that was produced by a machine, using some human-like methods, also through a process of Machine Learning where some inputs covers basically the machine with instructions and, using a model of speach prediction, based on innumerous texts and media analysed, the machine is able to output a text based on the prompt provided by the user. The content is produced with the assistance of AI algorithms. These algorithms can generate content autonomously or assist human creators in various creative and practical ways.   

  - 2- Is AI something new?
    - Not, it is not. Since the 50's, AI is studied and used, but with the revolutionary of Big Data, AI models could become even more efficient and precise.  

  - 3- How do these tools work in practice?
    - It has various forms of outputs, but we can describe some custom types of outputs: texts (imput prompt, model prediction, autonomous generation, refinements), images (input description, generative models, iterative refinements), content sumarization (input, model of NLP, sumarization quality), language translation, chatbots, etc. Very frequently, AI-generated content is just a simple algorith that receives an input, uses it's features, and delivers and output. Nowadays, with cloud computing and big data sets, it is becoming increasingly efficient the potential of outputs closer to human-like content. 

  - 4- What are some advantages of AI-generated content?
    - Suitabiliy and efficiency. 

  - 5- What are some drawbacks of AI-generated content?
    - Lack of trustworthy content, biased content, a huge increase in not-original content produced, a tremendous problem with plagiarism.
