- Pre-Reading
  - A. Warm-Up Questions 
    1. What are some jobs that machines can perform better than humans?
       - Usually, jobs that are meant to be repetitive, like in the movie Modern Times (1936) with Charles Chaplin. Also, machine jobs can be designated for very precise tasks, like measuring and cutting a specific type of fiber, metal, shapes and stuff. Of course, if there is a pointlessly iteration of the same work/task, that affects negatively any human being doing the same work, it is prefereble to employ a machine. Dangerous tasks could either be an asset, for example disarming explosive artifacts, or very raw/rought conditions, like on top of a mountain with low air density, or under thousands of meters underwater with it's outrageous pressure.
               
    3. How do you usually feel when new technology is released?
       - Generally, I feel hyped in the begining, and a litle stoked afterwards, when I do realise how deep theese kind of technology can become a burden to our daily lives, with lots of side-effects. In the end, I get myself a bit worried, for we live in the age of stupid-people carrying smarth-phones.
 
    4. What technology do you use the most in your daily life?
       - Basically all the technologies avaliable to someone not living off-the-grid.
